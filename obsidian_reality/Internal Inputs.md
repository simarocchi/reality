Let's postulate that our synapses are pretrained to decode the external Inputs. After a brief phase of tuning our internal inputs (dreaming of internal hallucination) are what define our reality. 
The next important question is: 

### how are the internal inputs generated ? 

I like to think that  as a mixture of 2 stimulus:

1. A physiological interaction coming from our neurotransmitters concentrations and physiological synapses structure. 
2. A quantum interactions happening in the microtubules according to [Orch-OR](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orch-Or) Roger Penrose Theory. Let's imagine the Microtubules as almost isolated systems where their unitary transformation in time is perturbed by a weak interaction with the rest of universe in such particular instant of time. We all know that is complicated to create "real" randomness but for now we delegate the randomness of our thoughts to these systems. 

The Orch-OR theory seems somehow related with the [Relational Quantum Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_quantum_mechanics) interpretation of Carlo Rovelli.

As far as I can understand the Rovelli interpretations these seems to me the relevant points:

- Isolated systems evolve in time according the Hamiltonian unitary trasformation of quantum mechanics.
- Non-isolated system reaches rapidly the classical limit for interactions by proximity with other systems. So all the quantum coherence effects decays and all the variables of the Non-isolated system are known in a given moment of the space-time.
- Bell's Inequality and EPR paradoxes are pointless constructions of mind, though they gain a Nobel prize in 2022.
