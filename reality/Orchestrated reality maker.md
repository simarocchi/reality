The Orchestrated reality maker get the inputs coming from [[Internal Inputs]] to hallucinate our reality and send it to the part of our brain where our consciousness  create a [[Reality Reconstruction]]. Such internal Inputs could be quite erratic they can be rectified with real [[External Inputs]].

Alternatively if we close our eyes we can also imagine (or dream) our objects or eventually our universe in a particular moment in time. 

In this case Internal and External stimulus can be completely segregated and after a sensory deprivation (to eliminate External stimulus) we can dream whatever Universe we want.

In summary:

Each Consciousness is a local quantum phenomena reduction influenced by the local geometry of space-time. So it is non-computational and influenced by gravity. 

- According to Relational Quantum Mechanics each consciousness is weakly interacting with any other consciousness happening in the same space-time geometry (What does it even mean ?) ?
